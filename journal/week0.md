# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Create Budget
This budget was created for $20. I have another budget rule in place because I have had this account for over 6 years.

### Create Budget Alert
This is the budget alert that sends out an email when the actual cost is greater than 80% ($16.00) of the budgeted amount ($20.00), the alert threshold will be exceeded.
Trust me I know how important this alert is because I recieved a nice bill a few years back when I was walking through some lab work to prepare myself for the SAA-C01.

## Homework Challenges

I was going to work on deploying budget alarms and setting up Eventbridge health alert with Terraform but this week has been crazy at work and I am out of town until Sunday so I was only able to get the EventBridge rule in place.
